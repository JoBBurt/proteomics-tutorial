## Peptide, Protein, Organellar or Vesicular Enrichment

### Protein enrichment (e.g. for protein protein interactions)


#### Proximity labeling for protein-protein interactions

Understanding protein interaction partners through proximity labeling experiments is critical to determining the function of a protein and to designing novel theraputics targeting specific protein pathways.
A comprehensive description of proximity labeling experiments using horseradis peroxidase (HRP), engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX), proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), and pupylation-based interaction tagging (Pup-IT) were recently reviewed by Bosch, et. al. 2021 [@PMID:32909689].
Breifly, these methods fuse an enzyme to specific proteins or signalling peptides with known subcellular localizations.
These enzymes label protein interaction patners with biotin-phenol, biotin, or bio-Pup(E) allowing subsequent isolation using streptavidin-coated beads or columns.

Interpreting proximity labeling experiments is complicated by the high number of background proteins retained throughout the isolation of biotinylated proteins [@DOI:10.3390/proteomes10020018].
Wash samples from the strepdavidin isolation and control samples with promiscuous biotinylation enzymes are critical for the identification of true interaction partners with the protein of interest.
