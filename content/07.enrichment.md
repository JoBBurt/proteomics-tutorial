## Peptide, Protein, Organellar or Vesicular Enrichment {.page.break}

### Peptide enrichment 

Many proteins undergo post-translational modification (PTM) due to environmental exposure and represent good targets for quantitave analysis [@PMID: 20622832]. There are over 400 PTMs which can be labile or stabile during mass spectrometry analysis.
* antibody enrichments of modifications, e.g. lysine acetylation [@DOI:10.1002/pmic.201800123].
* TiO2 and Fe enrichment of phosphorylation
* Glycosylation
* SISCAPA

### Protein enrichment (e.g. for protein protein interactions)

Proximity labeling experiments are used to determine the interaction partners of a target protien in and effort to understand the molecular function of a protein  in an effort to design novel theraputics that target specific protein pathways. A comprehensive description of proximity labeling experiments using horseradish peroxidase (HRP), engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX), proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), and pupylation-based interaction tagging (Pup-IT) were comprehensively reviewed by Bosch, et. al. 2021 [@PMID:32909689]. These methods fuse an enzyme to specific proteins or signalling peptides with known subcellular localizations and the enzymes label protein interaction partners with biotin-phenol, biotin, or bio-Pup(E) allowing subsequent isolation using streptavidin-coated beads or resins. The interpretation and identification of true interaction partners in proximity labeling experiments is complicated by the high number of background proteins retained throughout the isolation of biotinylated proteins due to non-specific interactions with streptavidin [PMID:35645376]. Data from the wash samples during the strepdavidin isolation contain valubale information on the retention of endogenously biotinylated carboxylases during the wash that can be used to establish a filter to eliminate background proteins in an effort to identify true interaction partners with the protein of interest through the use of cut-off ratio between the wash and elute fractions during bioinformatics analysis.

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) affinity purification methods are used to study protein-protein interactions or to determine the formation of complexes between known protein interactors [@PMID:35451753; @PMID:28667615]. The basic principal of co-IP experiments is that an antibody is used to bind complexes containing a bait protein to imobilize the target protein and any proteins that interact with or exist in a complex with the target protein on a solid matrix in a stable and specific manner so that background proteins can be washed away. The establishment of a robust co-IP assay requires considerable optimization with multiple variations of the basic technique needed for successful antigenic pull-down depending on cell source, protein localization, and the target of interest [@PMID:15064468; @PMID:17656778; @PMID:25859964].

BioPlex is a mass spectrometry network derived from affinity purification of epitope-tagged proteins that contains cell-line specific proteome scale interaction partners [@PMID: 26186194; @PMID: 28514442; @PMID: 33961781]. Affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments are used to identify , localize, and characterize proteins associated with one epitope-tagged protein in a high-throughput manner to form interactome models for an organism. In an AP-MS experimetns a lentivirus is used to infect cells to incorporate an open reading frame that will express the hemagglutinin (HA) protein with a bait protein. Cells are grown and lysed before anti-HA is used to purify the bait and any interacting proteins from the cell. The AP-MS protocol is detailed in the supplemental experimental procedures in the 2015 Cell publication by Huttlin et al.[@PMID: 26186194]  

### Organellar enrichment

Spatial proteomics experiments are used to understand the relationship between protein function and localization which are important for development of drug candidates to target specific cellular mechanics, biological processess, and molecular pathways that change with disease [@PMID:34906326]. Localization of organellar proteins by isotope tagging (LOPIT) is a method to determine subcellular protein location and distributions where organelles are separated into fractions using density-gradient centrifugation or differential ultracentrifugation [@PMID:15295017; @PMID:28471460; @PMID:30659192]. Proteins from each organelle co-localize in the density gradient and are digested then tagged with isobaric labels and multiplexed for relative quantification via mass spectrometry, data from these experiments are processed with machine learning algorithms to simplify the multiple parameters of the experiment  and group proteins by similarity [@PMID:15295017]. Spatial proteomes for human [@PMID:30659192; @PMID:34599159],  mouse [@PMID:26754106; @PMID:28471460], yeast [@PMID:30503867; @PMID:33654815], and toxoplasma [@PMID:33053376] are publicly available through the BioConductor packages pRoloc and pRolocData [@PMID:24413670; @PMID:31119032]. Spatial proteomes are information-rich maps that make possible the investigation of changes in cellular protein distributions after perturbation and are useful for the interpretation of proteomic data [@PMID:35645376].


### Vesiclular enrichment

Extracellular vesicles and exosomes encapsulate proteins actively secreted by the cell and have physical properties which allow them to be enriched from a variety of sources including blood plasma, serum, or cell culture media [@PMID:30637094]. Vesicular enrichment strategies are designed to deplete high abundance soluble proteins and to retain a high yeild of vesicle-associated proteins, a component of the secretory phenotype of cells, to reproducibly and repeatably increase the depth of coverage in mass spectrometry-based experiments. In 2021, two comprehensive reviews were published in Mass Spectrometry Reviews that detail strategies for the enrichment, characterization, and evaluation of exosomes and extracellular vesicle sample preparations for mass spectrometry-based biomarker discovery experiments [@PMID:34747512; @PMID:34632607].
